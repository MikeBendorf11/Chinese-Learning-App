### Chinese Learning Assistant

- All it does is help you learn Chinese **online or offline**. 
- Using the buttons, you can jump between different pronunciation difficulty **levels** while trying to guess the character(s) **combinations**.
- You can also **add** sentences, definitions and test your **drawing** skills.
- The next feature I want to add is external JSON storage, sentence and character review modes, and some fancy visual feedback for if you choose the correct answers.
- Web Workers and sentence mining is definitely a must, because it will save me a lot of learning time. 
- I created this project while studying for the [WebApp Microsoft Certification 70_480](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/learning/exam-70-480.aspx) 

#### Back-end
I used prototypes, Ajax calls, Google Translate API, IndexedDB API, cookies, event handling, delegation, and event bubbling.

#### Front-end 
I used Bootstrap 4, a combination of gradients and SVG. The mobile design has been tested for Android Chrome 68.0.34

- The drawing feature is part of an open source [project](http://www.kiang.org/jordan/software/hanzilookup/) by Jordan Kiang and  Erik Peterson.
- The 750 characters db is based on the SUBTLEX-CH open database of Chinese Word and Character Frequencies Based on Film. More info [here](http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/subtitle-frequencies/subtlex-ch)
