- It helps you learn Chinese online or offline. 
- Using the buttons, you can jump between different pronunciation difficulty levels while trying to guess the character(s) combinations.
- You can also add sentences, definitions and test your drawing skills.
- I created this project while studying for the [WebApp Microsoft Certification 70_480](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/learning/exam-70-480.aspx).

- External JSON storage, sentence and character review modes, and some fancy visual feedback for if you choose the correct answers.
- Web Workers and sentence mining is definitely a must.


#### Back-end
I used prototypes, Ajax calls, Google Translate API, IndexedDB API, cookies, event handling, delegation, and event bubbling.

#### Front-end 
I used Bootstrap 4, a combination of gradients and SVG. The mobile design has been tested for Android Chrome 68.0.34
