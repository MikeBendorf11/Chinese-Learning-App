## Chinese Learning Assistant

- Designed and created the app layout
- Wrote over 1500 lines of JS, HTML, and CSS code from scratch, using asynchronous calls, prototypes, IndexedDB and the Google API 
- The app allows the user to learn how to read and write Chinese characters and words
- The display allows editing of Hanzi combinations using an original roulette system
- Some of the technologies that I used include:
Ajax calls, Google Translate API, IndexedDB API, cookies, event handling, delegation, event bubbling, Bootstrap 4, CSS gradients and SVG backgrounds.

- External JSON storage, sentence and character review modes, and some fancy visual feedback for if you choose the correct answers.
- Web Workers and sentence mining is definitely a must.
